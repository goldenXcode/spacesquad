Space Squad is the worlds first squad based scrolling space shooter. Combining classic retro gameplay with innovative squad control and customisation mechanics this old genre has been revitalised for free on Android.

What is the biggest limitation in Android space shooters? the limitations of the touchscreen making fine control difficult.  Space squad makes this screen a feature rather than a drawback by reducing the size of your ships to allow minute control and supporting multi touch to divide your formation in two.

As you innevitably loose fighters, replacements will warp in to take thier place but when you ultimately run out of reinforcements it's game over.

Each enemy type is unique from the traditional 'seeker' who chases your squad to the deadly 'beam ships' that can clear a whole squad as they sweep past.

Recent changes have added high definition graphics, if you have graphical bugs please provide as much detail as possible.  If you can email me at tnind@computing.dundee.ac.uk.

The Space Squad beta is available for free on the Android Market.  Please leave honest but constructive feedback/error reports.
